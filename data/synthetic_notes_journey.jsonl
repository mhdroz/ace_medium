States her baseline is \"always a little short of breath\" but manageable with home oxygen at 2L via nasal cannula. Over the past 3 days, notes progressive worsening such that she becomes dyspneic with minimal exertion - walking from bedroom to bathroom (approximately 20 feet) now causes significant breathlessness requiring 5-10 minutes to recover. Prior to this exacerbation, she could complete this activity without stopping.\n\nAlso reports increased cough over same time period. Cough is productive of thick sputum that patient describes as \"yellow-green\" in color, different from her usual \"clear to white\" sputum. Estimates producing approximately 2-3 tablespoons of sputum daily (increased from baseline of occasional clear sputum). No hemoptysis.\n\nPatient has been using her albuterol rescue inhaler \"constantly\" - estimates using it 8-10 times per day (baseline is 2-3 times per day PRN). States the albuterol provides minimal relief compared to usual. Has been compliant with her other inhalers (tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol).\n\nDenies fever, chills, chest pain, palpitations, leg swelling, or orthopnea (though notes she always sleeps with 3 pillows due to COPD).

Describes pain as constant, sharp, 8/10 in severity, radiating to right shoulder. Pain is worse with deep breathing and movement. Nothing makes it better. Denies any similar pain in the past, though notes he has had occasional \"indigestion\" over past 2 years since gallstones were discovered.\n\nShortly after pain onset, patient developed fever with chills and rigors. Wife Helen measured temperature at home: 102.8\u00b0F. Patient also noted multiple episodes of nausea and non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting (approximately 5 episodes). Unable to tolerate any food or liquids. No diarrhea or constipation. Last bowel movement was yesterday morning (normal).\n\nThis morning (05/08), wife noted patient's eyes looked \"yellow.\" Patient looked in mirror and confirmed scleral icterus. Also noted his skin appeared jaundiced and his urine was \"very dark, like tea\" (suggesting bilirubinuria). Wife became very concerned and brought patient to ED around 17:00.\n\nIn ED, patient also noted abdominal pain has been constant, no relief with position changes. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or back pain (though has right shoulder pain as noted). No recent travel, no sick contacts, no recent antibiotic use. No known exposures to hepatitis.\n\nPatient has known history of gallstones diagnosed in 2022 on routine abdominal ultrasound done for \"indigestion.\" At that time, surgery was discussed but patient declined as he was having minimal symptoms (\"just some bloating after eating\").

Over the past 5 days, swelling has progressively worsened - now extends to mid-thigh bilaterally. Also notes her shoes and slippers no longer fit. Rings feel tight on fingers.\n\nOver same time period, patient notes marked decrease in urine output. Normally urinates 4-5 times daily; over past 3 days has only been urinating 1-2 times daily with \"very small amounts\" each time. Urine appears concentrated/dark yellow. No dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency (actually decreased frequency as noted).\n\nAlso reports progressive dyspnea over past 3 days. Now short of breath with minimal exertion - walking from bedroom to bathroom (approximately 30 feet) causes significant breathlessness requiring several minutes to recover. Also experiencing dyspnea at rest when lying flat - has been sleeping in recliner for past 2 nights (orthopnea). Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations.\n\nPatient admits to medication non-compliance over past 2 weeks. States she \"ran out\" of furosemide (Lasix) approximately 10 days ago and has not been taking it regularly. \"I felt fine so I didn't think I needed to refill it right away.\" Has been taking other medications (carvedilol, insulin) but admits to occasionally missing doses. Also admits to dietary indiscretion - attended granddaughter's graduation party last weekend (05/30) and \"ate a lot of salty foods\" including pizza, deli meats, potato chips.\n\nDaughter Sarah Thompson became concerned yesterday (06/04) when visiting mother and noticed significant leg swelling and difficulty breathing.

Pre-renal component suggested by elevated BUN/Cr ratio (likely from poor cardiac output/volume depletion to kidneys despite total body volume overload).\n\nCOMPLETE BLOOD COUNT:\n- WBC: 8.9 K/uL (normal)\n- Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL (LOW - anemia of chronic kidney disease)\n- Hematocrit: 31.2% (LOW)\n- MCV: 88 fL (normal - normocytic anemia)\n- Platelets: 198 K/uL (normal)\n\n**Interpretation:** Normocytic anemia, likely anemia of chronic kidney disease (common in CKD stage 3+).\n\nCARDIAC BIOMARKERS:\n- **BNP (B-type Natriuretic Peptide): 1250 pg/mL** (VERY ELEVATED - acute heart failure, normal <100)\n- Troponin I: 0.08 ng/mL (mildly elevated, likely from renal dysfunction + cardiac strain, not acute MI - no chest pain, EKG without acute changes)\n\n**Interpretation:** Markedly elevated BNP consistent with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\nURINALYSIS (catheterized specimen):\n- Color: Dark yellow/amber\n- Specific gravity: 1.025 (concentrated)\n- pH: 5.5\n- Protein: 3+ (significant proteinuria - known diabetic/hypertensive nephropathy)\n- Blood: Negative\n- Glucose: 2+ (glucosuria from diabetes)\n- Ketones: Negative\n- WBC: 2-5/hpf (normal)\n- RBC: 0-2/hpf (normal)\n- Casts: Granular casts present (renal tubular injury)\n\n**Interpretation:** Proteinuria consistent with known diabetic nephropathy, concentrated urine despite volume overload (kidney trying to retain fluid due to poor perfusion), granular casts suggest acute tubular injury.\n\nHEMOGLOBIN A1C: 7.9% (elevated - diabetes control suboptimal but acceptable for elderly patient with comorbidities)\n\nLIPID PANEL: Not checked\n\nIMAGING:\n\nCHEST X-RAY (PA and lateral, 06/05/2024 06:00):\n\"Cardiac silhouette enlarged (cardiomegaly), consistent with known cardiomyopathy. **Pulmonary vascular congestion present with cephalization of vessels**. **Small bilateral pleural effusions** (right > left). No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax.\n\nIMPRESSION: Findings consistent with congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.\"\n\nEKG (06:05):\n\"Sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm. Normal axis. Normal intervals. **Peaked T waves in V2-V6, II, III, aVF** (concerning for hyperkalemia - K 5.8). No acute ST-T changes to suggest ischemia. Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.

Cardiorenal syndrome: CHF causing reduced renal perfusion \u2192 AKI\n2. Hyperkalemia (5.8) - concerning, needs treatment\n3. Volume overload despite poor renal perfusion (\"overloaded and underfilled\")\n\n# RENAL - ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY (CARDIORENAL SYNDROME)\n- Baseline Cr 1.4 \u2192 now 3.2 (acute rise)\n- Etiology: **Cardiorenal syndrome type 1** (acute worsening of heart function causing acute kidney injury)\n  * Poor cardiac output from CHF \u2192 reduced renal perfusion\n  * Venous congestion \u2192 elevated renal venous pressure \u2192 decreased GFR\n- **ADMIT TO MEDICAL FLOOR** with telemetry (for hyperkalemia monitoring)\n\n- **NEPHROLOGY CONSULT** (Dr. Stone paged, accepts consult)\n  * Recommendations pending\n  * Will likely recommend gentle diuresis to improve renal perfusion\n\n- **HOLD NEPHROTOXIC MEDICATIONS:**\n  * **HOLD Lisinopril** (ACE inhibitor) - can worsen AKI and causing hyperkalemia\n  * Avoid NSAIDs, contrast dye\n\n- **GENTLE DIURESIS:**\n  * Goal: Remove excess fluid to improve cardiac output \u2192 improve renal perfusion\n  * BUT: Must be careful not to over-diurese (can worsen pre-renal AKI)\n  * Furosemide 40mg IV Q12H initially (double home dose)\n  * Monitor strict I/Os via Foley catheter\n  * Goal: Net negative 500-1000 mL per day (slow diuresis)\n  * Daily weights (goal: lose ~1-2 lbs per day)\n\n- **MONITOR RENAL FUNCTION:**\n  * BMP Q12H initially (follow Cr, K, BUN)\n  * Urinalysis with urine electrolytes\n  * If Cr continues to rise despite diuresis \u2192 may need to hold diuretics temporarily\n\n- **FLUID RESTRICTION:** 1.5-2 L per day total\n\n# RENAL - HYPERKALEMIA (K 5.8 - MODERATE, CONCERNING)\n- Etiology: AKI + ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) + poor urine output\n- EKG changes: Peaked T waves\n- **TREATMENT:**\n  * **Calcium gluconate 1g IV x1** (cardiac membrane stabilization) - given in ED\n  * **Insulin 10 units IV + D50 50mL IV** (shift K intracellularly) - given in ED\n  * **Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) 30g PO x1** (remove K from body)\n  * **HOLD Lisinopril** (ACE inhibitor contributing to hyperkalemia)\n  * **LOW POTASSIUM DIET**\n- **MONITORING:**\n  * Continuous telemetry (watch for arrhythmias from hyperkalemia)\n  * Repeat K in 4 hours, then Q12H\n  * Repeat EKG if K remains elevated or symptoms develop\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - ACUTE DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE (ADHF)\n- History: CHF with EF 35% (systolic dysfunction)\n- Presentation: Volume overload (8 lb weight gain, 3+ edema, orthopnea, dyspnea, JVD, S3, crackles, BNP 1250, CXR with congestion/effusions)\n- **Precipitating factors:**\n  * Medication non-compliance (stopped furosemide x 10 days)\n  * Dietary indiscretion (high salt intake at party)\n\n- **DIURESIS:** Furosemide 40mg IV Q12H as above\n\n- **FLUID RESTRICTION:** 2 L per day\n\n- **LOW SODIUM DIET:** <2g sodium per day\n\n- **CONTINUE BETA-BLOCKER:**\n  * Carvedilol 3.125mg PO BID (continue home dose)\n  * Important for CHF mortality benefit\n  * Monitor HR, BP\n\n- **HOLD ACE INHIBITOR:**\n  * Lisinopril held due to hyperkalemia and AKI\n  * Will restart at lower dose once K and Cr improve\n\n- **CARDIOLOGY CONSULT:**\n  * Dr. Murphy (patient's outpatient cardiologist) notified, will see patient\n  * May need to optimize CHF regimen\n\n- **DAILY WEIGHTS:** Goal net negative 1-2 lbs per day\n\n- **STRICT I/Os:** Foley catheter for accurate measurement\n\n- **TELEMETRY MONITORING:** For arrhythmias (hyperkalemia risk, CHF)\n\n- **REPEAT ECHOCARDIOGRAM:** Check if EF changed from baseline (last echo 01/2024)\n\n# ENDOCRINE - TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS\n- Continue insulin glargine 15 units SQ QHS\n- Insulin sliding scale (correction scale) for hyperglycemia\n- Check finger stick blood glucose QID (before meals and bedtime)\n- A1C 7.9% - acceptable control for elderly patient with multiple comorbidities\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - HYPERTENSION\n- BP elevated at 165/95 (volume overload contributing)\n- Continue carvedilol 3.125mg BID\n- Hold lisinopril as above (will restart when appropriate)\n- BP should improve with diuresis\n\n# HEMATOLOGY - ANEMIA\n- Hgb 10.2 (baseline ~11 per old records)\n- Likely anemia of chronic kidney disease\n- Check iron studies, B12, folate if not recently done\n- May need erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) if persistent\n- Nephrology to advise\n\n# FLUIDS/NUTRITION\n- Fluid restriction: 2 L per day\n- Cardiac diet: Low sodium (<2g/day), heart healthy\n- Diabetic diet: Carbohydrate controlled\n- Daily weights\n\n# PROPHYLAXIS\n- DVT: Will be bedbound initially - **heparin 5000 units SQ Q8H** (renal dosing)\n- GI: No indication for PPI\n- Bowel: Bowel regimen PRN (docusate, senna)\n\n# CODE STATUS\n- **FULL CODE** (confirmed with patient and daughter Sarah)\n- Healthcare proxy: Daughter Sarah Thompson (contact info in chart)\n\n# DISPOSITION\n- Admit to medical floor with telemetry\n- Anticipated length of stay: 4-5 days pending improvement in renal function and volume status\n- Will need visiting nurse services intensified at discharge for medication compliance and daily weight monitoring\n\n# SOCIAL WORK / CASE MANAGEMENT\n- Consult social work:\n  * Assess medication compliance barriers (cost? Understanding? Memory?)\n  * Ensure VNA services adequate (may need to increase to daily vs 2x/week)\n  * Ensure assisted living facility capable of monitoring daily weights\n- Daughter Sarah very involved - will participate in discharge planning\n\n# PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION\n- Extensive discussion with patient and daughter Sarah (both at bedside):\n  * Diagnosis: Heart failure exacerbation with kidney injury from not taking water pill\n  * Importance of taking ALL medications EVERY DAY, especially diuretics\n  * Importance of low-salt diet (avoiding processed foods, restaurant foods, salty snacks)\n  * Daily weights at home - call doctor if gain >3 lbs in 1 day or >5 lbs in 1 week\n  * Fluid restriction\n- Patient tearful, admits she \"should have been more careful\"\n- Daughter promises to help monitor medications\n- Both verbalize understanding\n\nPlan discussed with Dr. Wong (attending), nephrology team, and cardiology team.

Border of erythema is distinct and can be marked with pen. Area measures approximately 12 cm (length) x 8 cm (width). Skin appears taut, shiny. No purulent drainage. No ulceration. No black/necrotic tissue. No bullae or vesicles. Small healing abrasion visible at center of erythematous area (site of original trauma 1 week ago).\n- **Palpation:** Area is warm to touch compared to surrounding skin and compared to left leg. Tender to palpation - patient winces with firm pressure. No crepitus (important - rules out necrotizing fasciitis). No fluctuance (no abscess).\n- **Edema:** 1+ pitting edema of right lower leg (up to mid-calf), corresponds to area of erythema\n- **Pulses:** Dorsalis pedis 1+ (diminished but palpable - consistent with PVD), posterior tibial 1+ (diminished but palpable)\n- **Sensation:** Intact to light touch throughout (no evidence of sensory neuropathy at this time)\n- **Capillary refill:** 2-3 seconds (slightly delayed, likely from PVD)\n- **No lymphangitic streaking** (red streaks tracking up leg - would indicate lymphangitis, more severe)\n- **No inguinal lymphadenopathy**\n\n**LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY (for comparison):**\n- No erythema, warmth, or edema\n- Pulses: DP 1+, PT 1+ (also diminished - bilateral PVD)\n- Skin intact, no lesions\n\nSkin: No other rashes or lesions.

Sensation: Light touch intact in upper extremities. Lower extremities - should specifically test for diabetic neuropathy with monofilament (not done in ED, will do on floor).\n\nLABORATORY DATA (ED, drawn 14:30):\n\nCOMPLETE BLOOD COUNT:\n- **WBC: 14.8 K/uL** (ELEVATED - leukocytosis, consistent with infection)\n  * Differential: 82% neutrophils (elevated), 6% bands (LEFT SHIFT - bacterial infection)\n- Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL (low-normal for male, may indicate anemia of chronic disease)\n- Hematocrit: 36.5% (low-normal)\n- MCV: 85 fL (normocytic)\n- Platelets: 387 K/uL (elevated - reactive thrombocytosis from infection)\n\nBASIC METABOLIC PANEL:\n- Sodium: 138 mEq/L (normal)\n- Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L (normal)\n- Chloride: 102 mEq/L (normal)\n- CO2: 24 mEq/L (normal)\n- BUN: 18 mg/dL (normal)\n- Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL (normal - important to document baseline renal function in diabetic)\n- **Glucose: 285 mg/dL** (VERY ELEVATED - hyperglycemia, poor diabetes control)\n\nHEMOGLOBIN A1C (sent from ED):\n- **HbA1c: 9.8%** (VERY ELEVATED - goal <7%, indicates poor glycemic control over past 3 months)\n\nURINALYSIS:\n- Color: Yellow\n- Specific gravity: 1.020\n- pH: 6.0\n- Glucose: 3+ (glucosuria from hyperglycemia)\n- Ketones: Negative (no DKA)\n- Protein: Trace\n- Blood: Negative\n- Nitrites: Negative\n- Leukocyte esterase: Negative\n- WBC: 0-2/hpf (normal)\n\n** Should send urine microalbumin to assess for diabetic nephropathy\n\nMICROBIOLOGY:\n- **Blood cultures x2 sets drawn at 14:45** (pending, will follow for bacteremia)\n\nIMAGING: None obtained (cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis, imaging not needed unless concerned for deeper infection/abscess)\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN:\n45-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 9.8%), peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and active tobacco use presenting with right lower extremity cellulitis following minor trauma 1 week ago. Classic presentation with well-demarcated erythema, warmth, tenderness, and fever. No signs of deeper infection (no crepitus, no necrosis, no abscess). Adequate perfusion to right leg (pulses palpable despite PVD).\n\n**RISK FACTORS for cellulitis:** Diabetes (immunocompromised), PVD (impaired perfusion/healing), obesity, skin break from trauma\n\n# INFECTIOUS DISEASE - RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY CELLULITIS\n- Clinical diagnosis: Well-demarcated erythema, warmth, tenderness, fever, leukocytosis\n- Etiology: Likely **Streptococcus pyogenes** (Group A Strep) or **Staphylococcus aureus** following skin break\n- No signs of necrotizing fasciitis (no crepitus, no rapid progression, no severe pain out of proportion, no bullae)\n- No abscess formation (no fluctuance)\n- Adequate perfusion (pulses palpable - important given PVD)\n\n- **ADMIT TO MEDICAL FLOOR** for IV antibiotics\n\n- **IV ANTIBIOTICS:**\n  * **Clindamycin 600mg IV Q8H** (600mg given in ED, continue Q8H)\n  * Rationale: Covers both Strep and Staph (including some MRSA coverage)\n  * Alternative to beta-lactams given PCN resistance concerns\n  * Good tissue penetration\n  * Duration: Likely 2-3 days IV, then transition to PO once afebrile and erythema improving\n\n- **MARK BORDERS** of erythema with surgical marker (already done in ED)\n  * Track progression/improvement over next 24-48 hours\n  * Document measurements daily\n\n- **ELEVATION:** Keep right leg elevated when in bed/chair (reduces edema, improves venous return)\n\n- **MONITOR:**\n  * Vital signs Q4H (follow fever curve)\n  * Assess cellulitis Q8H (measure erythema, assess warmth, tenderness)\n  * Watch for signs of worsening: Crepitus, bullae, necrosis, lymphangitic streaking, sepsis\n\n- **BLOOD CULTURES:** Pending - will tailor antibiotics if positive (though usually negative in uncomplicated cellulitis)\n\n- **PAIN CONTROL:** Acetaminophen 650mg PO Q6H PRN fever/pain (avoid NSAIDs given diabetes/PVD)\n\n# ENDOCRINE - TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (POORLY CONTROLLED)\n- HbA1c 9.8% (VERY POOR CONTROL, goal <7%)\n- Current glucose 285 mg/dL (hyperglycemia)\n- Current regimen INADEQUATE: Metformin 500mg BID + glipizide 5mg daily\n- Poor medication compliance per patient\n- No endocrine follow-up\n\n** INFECTION WORSENS GLYCEMIC CONTROL - need intensive management during hospitalization\n\n- **ENDOCRINOLOGY CONSULT** (will request urgent consult for insulin initiation)\n\n- **HOLD ORAL DIABETIC MEDICATIONS** during acute illness:\n  * HOLD metformin (risk of lactic acidosis in setting of infection, though patient not septic)\n  * HOLD glipizide (risk of hypoglycemia with erratic PO intake)\n\n- **START INSULIN:**\n  * Insulin glargine (Lantus) 20 units SQ QHS (basal insulin - will titrate based on fasting glucose)\n  * Insulin lispro (Humalog) sliding scale before meals and at bedtime (correctional insulin)\n  * Goal blood glucose: 140-180 mg/dL during hospitalization\n\n- **INTENSIVE GLUCOSE MONITORING:**\n  * Finger stick blood glucose AC (before meals) and HS (at bedtime) = QID\n  * May need Q4H initially if very unstable\n\n- **DIABETES EDUCATION:**\n  * Patient will need extensive education on insulin administration before discharge\n  * Likely will need to continue insulin at home given poor control on oral agents\n\n- **ASSESS FOR DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS:**\n  * Retinopathy: Needs ophthalmology referral (last eye exam 2 years ago)\n  * Nephropathy: Send urine microalbumin, assess renal function (Cr 1.0 today is good)\n  * Neuropathy: Perform monofilament exam on floor (check for loss of protective sensation)\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE\n- Known PVD with ABI 0.75-0.82 bilaterally (abnormal)\n- Claudication symptoms with walking >2 blocks\n- Diminished but palpable pedal pulses bilaterally\n- **Adequate perfusion to heal cellulitis** (important prognostic factor)\n\n- **VASCULAR SURGERY AWARE** of admission (no acute intervention needed, but may want to see patient)\n\n- Continue aspirin for cardiovascular risk reduction - **ADD aspirin 81mg PO daily** (should be on this already given PVD)\n\n- Smoking cessation counseling CRITICAL (smoking worsens PVD)\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - HYPERTENSION\n- BP 148/92 (slightly elevated, likely from pain/infection)\n- Continue lisinopril 10mg PO daily\n- Monitor BP\n\n# SMOKING CESSATION\n- Active smoker, 20 pack-year history\n- **CRITICAL** to quit given diabetes + PVD (smoking dramatically worsens both conditions)\n- Offer smoking cessation counseling, nicotine replacement therapy\n\n# PROPHYLAXIS\n- DVT: Ambulatory, no prophylaxis needed (will be up and walking)\n- GI: No indication for PPI\n\n# CODE STATUS: FULL CODE (confirmed with patient)\n\n# DISPOSITION\n- Admit to medical floor\n- Anticipated length of stay: 3-4 days (transition to PO antibiotics when afebrile and improving)\n- Will need close diabetes follow-up after discharge (endocrine referral)\n- Work restrictions: Light duty for 1 week after discharge (avoid trauma to healing leg)\n\n# SOCIAL WORK / DIABETES EDUCATION\n- Consult diabetes educator: Patient will need insulin teaching before discharge\n- Consult social work: Assess barriers to medication compliance, ensure access to insulin/supplies (MassHealth should cover)\n- Smoking cessation resources\n\n# PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION\n- Discussion with patient and wife Rosa (both at bedside):\n  * Diagnosis: Skin infection (cellulitis) in right leg from minor injury\n  * Treatment: IV antibiotics for a few days, then pills at home\n  * Diabetes very poorly controlled - will be starting insulin (patient apprehensive but understands need)\n  * Smoking MUST stop - worsening diabetes and blood vessel disease\n- Patient and wife verbalize understanding\n- Wife very supportive, will help with insulin administration at home\n\nPlan discussed with Dr. Rodriguez (attending). Endocrine consult placed (urgent).

Went to urgent care the next day, was diagnosed with lumbar strain, and was advised to take ibuprofen 800mg three times daily for pain and inflammation. Patient has been taking ibuprofen 800mg TID religiously for past 2 weeks (total: 2400mg ibuprofen per day x 14 days).\n\nTwo days ago (08/20), patient noticed his first black, tarry bowel movement. States stool was \"pitch black, sticky, and had a very foul odor\" - classic description of melena. Initially thought it might be from something he ate, but then had 2 more similar bowel movements that day. Also began feeling increasingly fatigued and weak.\n\nYesterday (08/21), had 3 more episodes of black, tarry stools. Fatigue worsened significantly - could barely get out of bed, felt exhausted with minimal activity. Wife Janet noticed he looked \"very pale.\" Patient thought he might be \"coming down with something\" but wife became concerned about the black stools and insisted he seek medical attention.\n\nThis morning (08/22), had 2 more episodes of melena. Wife brought patient to ED around 17:00.\n\nPatient denies:\n- Hematemesis (no vomiting blood or \"coffee ground\" emesis)\n- Hematochezia (no bright red blood per rectum)\n- Abdominal pain (no epigastric pain, no cramping)\n- Nausea or vomiting (other than absence of hematemesis)\n- Dizziness or syncope (though feels weak/fatigued)\n- Chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath (though feels \"winded\" with activity, likely from anemia)\n- Fevers, chills, or night sweats\n- Recent alcohol binge (drinks 2-3 beers per week, unchanged)\n- Other NSAID use besides ibuprofen\n- Anticoagulant use (no warfarin, no other blood thinners besides aspirin 81mg daily)\n\nPatient has history of peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2019 when he had similar episode of melena. At that time, EGD showed duodenal ulcer and he tested positive for H. pylori. Was treated with triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin) for H. pylori eradication.

ACUTE UPPER GI BLEEDING (LIKELY NSAID-INDUCED ULCER)\n- Presentation: Melena x2 days, severe anemia (Hgb 7.8), elevated BUN/Cr ratio (37.5)\n- Etiology: **Most likely NSAID-induced peptic ulcer** (ibuprofen 800mg TID x 2 weeks)\n  * Patient also on aspirin 81mg daily (additional risk)\n  * History of PUD (duodenal ulcer 2019, H. pylori treated)\n  * NOT on PPI prophylaxis despite history\n- **HIGH RISK for rebleeding** given severe anemia, ongoing melena\n\n- **ADMIT TO MEDICAL FLOOR with TELEMETRY** (monitor for cardiac ischemia from anemia)\n\n- **RESUSCITATION:**\n  * **2 large-bore IVs** (18G x2) - adequate access for rapid transfusion if needed\n  * **IV fluids:** NS at 125 mL/hr initially (1L bolus already given in ED)\n  * **Transfusion:** **Goal Hemoglobin >7-8 g/dL** (restrictive strategy unless cardiac ischemia develops)\n    - **Transfuse 2 units PRBCs tonight** (already cross-matched)\n    - Recheck CBC in AM\n    - May need additional transfusion based on repeat Hgb and ongoing bleeding\n  * **Correct coagulopathy:** None present (INR 1.0, PTT normal)\n\n- **HIGH-DOSE PPI PROTOCOL:**\n  * **Pantoprazole 80mg IV bolus** (already given in ED)\n  * **Pantoprazole 8mg/hr IV continuous infusion** (started in ED, continue for 72 hours)\n  * Rationale: High-dose PPI decreases rebleeding risk by maintaining gastric pH >6, promotes clot stability\n  * After 72 hours, will transition to PO PPI BID\n\n- **NPO** (nothing by mouth) until after EGD tomorrow\n\n- **URGENT EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy):**\n  * **SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW AM** (08/23, ~08:00)\n  * GI attending (Dr. Kim) and fellow aware, patient on schedule\n  * Indications: Diagnosis, hemostasis if active bleeding, risk stratification\n  * Consent obtained from patient\n  * Will assess:\n    - Source of bleeding (likely duodenal or gastric ulcer)\n    - Forrest classification (active bleeding vs visible vessel vs clean base)\n    - Apply thermal therapy, clips, or injection if high-risk stigmata\n    - Test for H. pylori (rapid urease test, biopsy)\n\n- **STOP NSAIDs PERMANENTLY:**\n  * **DISCONTINUE ibuprofen** - DO NOT restart\n  * Counsel patient extensively on dangers of NSAIDs with PUD history\n  * Patient to AVOID all NSAIDs: ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac, etc.\n\n- **HOLD ASPIRIN:**\n  * Aspirin 81mg held temporarily (increases bleeding risk)\n  * Will reassess after ulcer healed (8 weeks)\n  * If truly indicated for cardiovascular disease, may restart with PPI prophylaxis\n\n- **SERIAL HEMOGLOBIN CHECKS:**\n  * CBC Q8H x 24 hours, then Q12H\n  * Monitor for ongoing bleeding (decreasing Hgb despite transfusion)\n  * Monitor for appropriate rise post-transfusion (expect ~1 g/dL per unit PRBC)\n\n- **MONITOR VITAL SIGNS:**\n  * Vital signs Q4H\n  * Watch for hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia worsening)\n  * Watch for signs of rebleeding (hematemesis, increased melena, hemodynamic changes)\n\n- **TELEMETRY MONITORING:**\n  * Severe anemia (Hgb 7.8) increases risk of cardiac ischemia\n  * Monitor for arrhythmias, ST changes\n\n- **STRICT I/Os:**\n  * Foley catheter if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable (not needed currently)\n  * Monitor for adequate urine output (goal >30 mL/hr) - indicates adequate perfusion\n\n- **STOOL MONITORING:**\n  * Document all bowel movements\n  * Note color (melena vs formed brown vs hematochezia)\n\n# GASTROINTESTINAL - PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (HISTORY)\n- History of duodenal ulcer 2019, H. pylori treated (eradication confirmed)\n- Was NOT on PPI prophylaxis despite history - patient at high risk\n- Current ulcer likely NSAID-induced (new insult)\n- Will test for H. pylori at EGD (though less likely given prior eradication)\n- Long-term: Will need PPI therapy, likely prolonged\n\n# MUSCULOSKELETAL - ACUTE ON CHRONIC BACK PAIN\n- Chronic L4-L5 disc disease with acute exacerbation from lifting injury\n- Patient was taking ibuprofen 800mg TID - **CANNOT continue NSAIDs**\n\n- **ALTERNATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT:**\n  * **Acetaminophen 650mg PO Q6H PRN pain** (safe alternative, no GI bleeding risk)\n    - Maximum 4g per day\n  * Ice/heat therapy\n  * Will consult physical therapy\n  * If inadequate pain control, may consider short course of muscle relaxant (cyclobenzaprine)\n  * May need interventional pain management consultation as outpatient (epidural injections)\n  * **NO NSAIDs, NO COX-2 inhibitors** (celecoxib also increases ulcer risk)\n\n- **PHYSICAL THERAPY CONSULT** (for back pain management after discharge)\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - HYPERTENSION (STABLE)\n- BP 110/65 (on lower side, likely from volume loss)\n- Continue lisinopril 10mg daily once hemodynamically stable and tolerating POs\n- Monitor BP\n\n# ANEMIA - ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA (SEVERE)\n- Hgb 7.8 (severe), Hct 24%\n- Etiology: Acute GI blood loss from peptic ulcer\n- Normocytic (MCV 88) - consistent with acute blood loss\n- **Transfuse 2 units PRBCs tonight**, recheck AM\n- Monitor for appropriate response\n- Once bleeding controlled, will likely need oral iron supplementation\n\n# PROPHYLAXIS\n- DVT: Ambulating currently, but if bedbound will start **heparin 5000 units SQ Q12H** (use lower dose given GI bleeding risk)\n  * **Hold DVT prophylaxis initially** given active GI bleeding\n  * Will reassess after EGD and hemostasis achieved\n- GI: Already on high-dose PPI\n- Bowel: Hold bowel regimen (want to monitor stool quality)\n\n# CODE STATUS: **FULL CODE** (confirmed with patient and wife)\n\n# DISPOSITION\n- Admit to medical floor with telemetry\n- Anticipated length of stay: 3-4 days pending EGD results and cessation of bleeding\n- Will need close GI follow-up after discharge\n- Will need repeat EGD in 6-8 weeks to confirm ulcer healing\n\n# PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION\n- Extensive discussion with patient and wife Janet (both at bedside):\n  * Diagnosis: Bleeding ulcer in stomach or intestine, likely from ibuprofen\n  * Treatment: IV medications to stop bleeding, blood transfusion, camera test tomorrow (EGD)\n  * **CRITICAL: Can NEVER take ibuprofen or other NSAIDs again** - can cause more bleeding\n  * Will need long-term medication to protect stomach (PPI)\n  * Prognosis: Should do well with treatment\n- Patient very upset that ibuprofen caused this: \"The urgent care doctor told me to take it, didn't warn me about ulcers. I have a history of ulcers!\"\n- Wife also concerned, supportive\n- Both verbalize understanding of seriousness and plan\n\nPlan discussed with Dr. Susan Kim (attending GI), GI fellow on call.

Husband left to go to grocery store around 07:30.\n- **Patient discovered: 10:00 (10 AM) on 09/10/2024** - Husband returned home from store around 10:00 AM, found patient in bed awake but with left-sided weakness and slurred speech. Patient unable to tell him exactly when symptoms started (expressive aphasia component).\n- **EMS called: 10:05 AM** - Husband immediately called 911\n- **EMS arrival: 10:15 AM** - Paramedics noted left facial droop, left arm and leg weakness, slurred speech\n- **ED arrival: 10:45 AM** - Patient brought to ED, \"stroke code\" called\n\n**Symptoms at presentation:**\nPatient (with difficulty speaking) and husband report:\n- **Left facial droop** - husband noticed left side of face \"drooping,\" mouth asymmetric\n- **Left arm weakness** - patient unable to lift left arm, \"felt heavy and weak\"\n- **Left leg weakness** - patient could move left leg but weaker than right\n- **Slurred speech (dysarthria)** - speech difficult to understand, \"garbled\"\n- **Possible word-finding difficulty** - some difficulty expressing herself (husband notes this is not her baseline - she is very articulate normally as former English teacher)\n\nPatient denies:\n- Headache (no severe headache, no \"worst headache of life\")\n- Vision changes (no vision loss, no double vision)\n- Vertigo or dizziness\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Chest pain or palpitations (though has baseline irregular heartbeat from Afib)\n- Loss of consciousness or seizure activity\n- Confusion (alert, knows who she is, where she is, recognizes husband)\n\n**Review of stroke risk factors:**\n- **Atrial fibrillation:** Diagnosed 2018, chronic/persistent, **NOT on anticoagulation**\n  * CHADS2-VASc score: **4 points** (CHF 0, HTN 1, Age>75 0 [age 71], DM 0, Stroke/TIA 2, Vascular disease 0, Age 65-74 1, Sex female 1) = HIGH RISK for stroke (~4% annual risk)\n  * **Reason NOT on anticoagulation:** Patient has history of multiple falls (3 falls in past year, most recent 2 months ago). Shared decision-making with prior neurologist and cardiologist - deemed fall risk too high for anticoagulation (risk of intracranial hemorrhage from fall on anticoagulant). Patient and family agreed with this decision at the time.\n  * Was on aspirin 81mg daily until 2023, then stopped (unclear why - patient doesn't recall, may have been stopped by prior provider)\n- **Hypertension:** Long-standing, on medications but not optimally controlled (home BP 140s-150s/80s-90s)\n- **Hyperlipidemia:** On statin but not high-intensity dose\n- **Prior TIA:** 2022 - had transient right arm weakness and speech difficulty, resolved completely within 2 hours, MRI at that time showed no acute stroke. Workup: Carotid ultrasound showed <50% stenosis, echo showed Afib. Was counseled at that time about stroke risk and anticoagulation, but declined due to fall risk.\n- **Age 71:** Increasing stroke risk with age\n\n**Other relevant history:**\n- Multiple falls: 3 falls in past year, most recent 2 months ago (tripped over rug, fell forward, bruised knee but no serious injury).

NIHSS 8 (moderate severity). Last known normal >12 hours ago, **outside tPA window**, not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy. CT head shows no hemorrhage. Most likely etiology: **cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation** (patient not on anticoagulation).\n\n**Stroke Risk Factors:**\n- Atrial fibrillation (CHADS2-VASc 4 - HIGH RISK)\n- NOT on anticoagulation (major modifiable risk factor)\n- Hypertension (suboptimally controlled)\n- Hyperlipidemia (LDL 118, not at goal)\n- Prior TIA (2022)\n- Age 71\n- Strong family history of stroke\n\n# NEUROLOGY - ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, RIGHT MCA TERRITORY\n\n- **Diagnosis:** Acute ischemic stroke, right MCA territory (cortical branch vs. small striatocapsular)\n- **Severity:** NIHSS 8 (moderate)\n- **Etiology:** Most likely **cardioembolic from atrial fibrillation** (patient not anticoagulated)\n- **Time course:** Last known normal 22:00 on 09/09, symptoms discovered 10:00 on 09/10, **outside tPA window**\n- **Not a candidate for acute reperfusion therapy** (tPA or thrombectomy)\n\n- **ADMIT TO NEUROLOGY STROKE SERVICE** with continuous telemetry monitoring\n\n- **STROKE PROTOCOL:**\n  * Neuro checks Q2H x 24 hours, then Q4H\n  * NIH Stroke Scale Q6H x 24 hours\n  * Continuous telemetry (monitor for arrhythmias, Afib with RVR)\n  * Aspiration precautions (NPO until swallow evaluation - dysarthria suggests possible dysphagia risk)\n  * HOB >30 degrees\n  * Fall precautions (bed alarm, non-slip socks, assistance with ambulation)\n\n- **ANTIPLATELET THERAPY:**\n  * **Aspirin 325mg PO daily** (acute stroke dose, given in ED)\n  * Will continue for 21-30 days, then decrease to 81mg daily\n  * Eventually will transition to anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention (see below)\n\n- **PERMISSIVE HYPERTENSION:**\n  * **Do NOT aggressively lower BP in acute stroke** (unless >220/120)\n  * Target BP <220/120 for first 24-48 hours (allow cerebral perfusion to ischemic penumbra)\n  * After 24-48 hours, can gradually lower BP to <180/110, then to goal <140/90\n  * **HOLD home antihypertensives initially** (lisinopril, metoprolol for first 24-48 hours)\n  * Resume home medications after 48 hours, may need to uptitrate\n\n- **STATIN THERAPY:**\n  * **STOP simvastatin 20mg** (low-intensity statin, inadequate for stroke patient)\n  * **START atorvastatin 80mg PO daily** (high-intensity statin)\n  * Goal LDL <70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention\n\n- **WORKUP TO DETERMINE STROKE ETIOLOGY AND GUIDE SECONDARY PREVENTION:**\n  * **MRI brain with DWI/ADC** (ASAP, preferably today) - determine infarct size, location, age, rule out other infarcts\n  * **MRA head and neck** (with MRI) - assess for intracranial stenosis, vertebrobasilar insufficiency\n  * **Carotid duplex ultrasound** - assess for carotid stenosis (if severe, may need endarterectomy)\n  * **Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)** - assess for cardiac source of embolism (thrombus, valvular disease, PFO, EF)\n  * **24-hour telemetry** (already on telemetry) - document Afib burden\n  * **Fasting lipid panel** (already done - LDL 118)\n  * **Hemoglobin A1c** (already done - 5.8%, no diabetes)\n\n- **SWALLOW EVALUATION:**\n  * **Speech pathology consult** for bedside swallow evaluation\n  * Patient has dysarthria (suggests bulbar involvement) - risk of dysphagia/aspiration\n  * **NPO until swallow eval cleared**\n  * If fails, may need video swallow study, modified diet, or NGT\n\n- **SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS:** Not indicated (no seizure, small cortical stroke)\n\n- **DVT PROPHYLAXIS:**\n  * **Heparin 5000 units SQ Q12H** (subcutaneous DVT prophylaxis)\n  * Patient has hemiparesis - immobile left side - DVT risk\n  * Will reassess once on anticoagulation for Afib\n\n# CARDIOLOGY - ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (NOT ANTICOAGULATED - NEEDS SECONDARY STROKE PREVENTION)\n\n- **Patient now has HAD A STROKE from Afib** - this fundamentally changes risk-benefit calculation\n- **CHADS2-VASc score NOW: 6 points** (Stroke/TIA now 2\u21924 points given actual stroke) = VERY HIGH risk of recurrent stroke (~10% annual risk without anticoagulation)\n- **Fall risk vs. stroke risk:** Must reevaluate - **risk of recurrent stroke now MUCH HIGHER than risk of ICH from fall**\n\n- **Plan to INITIATE ANTICOAGULATION for secondary stroke prevention:**\n  * **Timing:** Start anticoagulation after 24-48 hours (once hemorrhagic conversion ruled out with repeat imaging)\n  * **Options:** Warfarin vs. DOAC (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran)\n  * **Discussion with patient and family:** \n    - Patient has now had stroke BECAUSE she was not anticoagulated\n    - Risk of recurrent stroke ~10% per year without anticoagulation (extremely high)\n    - Risk of major bleeding with anticoagulation ~2-3% per year\n    - Risk of ICH from fall on anticoagulation ~1% per year\n    - **Benefits of anticoagulation NOW outweigh risks**\n    - Will need extensive discussion about fall prevention strategies\n\n- **Cardiology consultation** for anticoagulation recommendations, Afib management\n\n- **Continue metoprolol 50mg BID** for rate control (will resume after 48 hours)\n\n# HYPERTENSION (SUBOPTIMALLY CONTROLLED)\n- BP elevated at 165/100 (permissive in acute stroke)\n- **HOLD antihypertensives x 48 hours** (permissive hypertension in acute stroke)\n- After 48 hours, resume and likely UPTITRATE:\n  * May increase lisinopril from 5mg \u2192 10mg daily\n  * Continue metoprolol 50mg BID (also for Afib rate control)\n- Goal BP <140/90 long-term for secondary stroke prevention\n\n# HYPERLIPIDEMIA (NOT AT GOAL)\n- LDL 118 mg/dL (goal <70 for stroke patient)\n- **STOP simvastatin 20mg** (low-intensity, inadequate)\n- **START atorvastatin 80mg daily** (high-intensity statin)\n- Recheck lipid panel in 6 weeks, goal LDL <70\n\n# FALLS - HIGH RISK (PREVIOUSLY REASON FOR NOT ANTICOAGULATING)\n- **Fall risk assessment CRITICAL now that starting anticoagulation**\n- **Physical therapy consultation:**\n  * Gait and balance assessment\n  * Strengthening exercises\n  * Assistive device recommendation (should use cane CONSISTENTLY)\n  * Home safety evaluation\n- **Occupational therapy consultation:**\n  * ADL assessment\n  * Home modifications\n  * Adaptive equipment\n- **Home safety evaluation** before discharge\n- Patient and family education on fall prevention\n\n# DYSPHAGIA RISK\n- **Speech pathology consultation** for swallow evaluation\n- NPO until cleared\n- If dysphagia, may need modified diet, aspiration precautions\n\n# REHABILITATION\n- **Physical therapy** - assess mobility, strength, gait, transfers\n- **Occupational therapy** - assess ADLs, fine motor skills, home safety\n- **Speech therapy** - assess dysphagia, dysarthria, aphasia\n- Will likely need continued therapy at home or acute rehab depending on progress\n\n# PROPHYLAXIS\n- DVT: Heparin 5000 units SQ Q12H (will transition to anticoagulation)\n- GI: Not indicated\n- Bowel: Bowel regimen PRN\n\n# CODE STATUS: **FULL CODE** (confirmed with patient and husband)\n- Healthcare proxy: Husband William Taylor\n\n# DISPOSITION\n- Admit to neurology stroke service\n- Telemetry monitoring\n- Anticipated length of stay: 5-7 days\n- Will likely discharge home with home health services (PT, OT, nursing) vs. acute rehab depending on progress\n\n# PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION\n- Extensive discussion with patient (to extent possible given aphasia/dysarthria) and husband William (primary spokesperson):\n  * Diagnosis: Stroke (blockage in blood vessel in brain) causing left-sided weakness and speech difficulty\n  * Cause: Blood clot from heart (atrial fibrillation) traveled to brain\n  * **CRITICAL DISCUSSION about anticoagulation:**\n    - Patient was NOT on blood thinners because of fall risk\n    - Patient has now HAD A STROKE because not on blood thinners\n    - Risk of another stroke is VERY HIGH (10% per year) without blood thinners\n    - **Recommendation: START blood thinners** despite fall risk\n    - Risk of bleeding from fall is LOWER than risk of another stroke\n    - Will work on fall prevention (PT, home safety, assistive devices)\n  * Treatment: Aspirin now, will start blood thinners in a few days\n  * Prognosis: Many stroke patients improve with therapy, but may have residual weakness\n  * Will need rehabilitation (PT, OT, speech therapy)\n- **Husband very emotional** - feels guilty that they decided against blood thinners in past\n- **Patient tearful but understanding** (nods appropriately, limited verbal response)\n- Reassured that decision made at the time was reasonable given fall risk, but now circumstances have changed\n- Both agree to start anticoagulation\n\nPlan discussed with Dr. Christopher Lee (stroke attending). MRI brain/MRA ordered stat. Cardiology consult placed. PT/OT/Speech consults placed.

Patient was independent with ADLs prior to fall. Now with severe pain, unable to bear weight. Neurovascular status intact. **Requires surgical fixation** - plan for ORIF (open reduction internal fixation) tomorrow morning.\n\n**HIP FRACTURE RISK FACTORS:**\n- Age 84 (elderly)\n- Female\n- Osteoporosis (NOT on pharmacologic treatment since 2020)\n- Low calcium/vitamin D intake\n- Frail (thin, low BMI 21)\n- History of falls (2 in past year)\n- Lives alone (no supervision)\n- Mild cognitive impairment\n\n**PERIOPERATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **ASA Class:** III (severe systemic disease - age, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, but stable)\n- **Cardiac risk:** Low (no active cardiac disease, normal EKG)\n- **Pulmonary risk:** Low (clear CXR, no lung disease)\n- **Delirium risk:** **HIGH** (age >80, baseline cognitive impairment, already showing signs of delirium, hip fracture, surgery)\n\n# ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY - RIGHT FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE (GARDEN GRADE III)\n- Displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture\n- **Requires urgent surgical fixation** (within 24-48 hours to reduce risk of avascular necrosis, nonunion, and complications of immobility)\n- **Surgical options discussed with orthopedic team:**\n  * **ORIF (open reduction internal fixation)** with cannulated screws or sliding hip screw\n  * **Hemiarthroplasty** (femoral head replacement)\n  * **Total hip arthroplasty** (THR)\n- **Decision:** Plan for **ORIF** given patient's good pre-injury functional status and desire to preserve native hip\n  * Rationale: Patient was ambulatory without assistive device, independent, active - good candidate for ORIF\n  * Alternative (hemiarthroplasty or THR) considered but ORIF preferred if patient was high-functioning\n  * Dr. Johnson (attending orthopedic surgeon) evaluated patient, agrees with ORIF plan\n\n- **ADMIT TO ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY SERVICE**\n\n- **SURGERY SCHEDULED: 10/04/2024 at 08:00** (tomorrow morning, first case)\n  * Procedure: ORIF right femoral neck fracture\n  * Surgeon: Dr. Michael Johnson\n  * Anesthesia: General vs. spinal (anesthesia to decide)\n  * Consent obtained from patient (patient has capacity to consent despite mild cognitive impairment) and daughter present\n\n- **PRE-OPERATIVE ORDERS:**\n  * **NPO after midnight** (already NPO since ED arrival)\n  * IV fluids: NS at 75 mL/hr (gentle hydration, elderly patient)\n  * **Pain control:**\n    - Morphine 2-4mg IV Q4H PRN severe pain (already given 4mg in ED)\n    - Acetaminophen 650mg PO Q6H scheduled (standing, helps with pain and reduces opioid needs)\n  * **DVT prophylaxis:** Heparin 5000 units SQ Q8H (start tonight - hip fracture = high DVT risk)\n  * **Foley catheter:** Keep in place (accurate I/Os, patient can't get up to bathroom)\n  * **Bowel regimen:** Docusate 100mg PO BID (prevent constipation from opioids)\n  * Pre-op labs: Already done (CBC, BMP, coags)\n  * Type and screen: Done (2 units available)\n  * CXR: Done (clear)\n  * EKG: Done (normal)\n  * **Hold amlodipine morning of surgery** (will hold antihypertensives day of surgery per anesthesia protocol)\n\n- **POST-OPERATIVE PLAN (anticipated):**\n  * Weight-bearing status: Will depend on fracture stability and fixation quality, likely **weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT)** or **toe-touch weight-bearing (TTWB)** initially\n  * Physical therapy: Start POD#1 (post-operative day 1)\n  * Pain control: Transition to PO opioids + acetaminophen\n  * Anticoagulation: Continue heparin SQ, consider chemical prophylaxis vs. mechanical (SCDs) depending on bleeding risk\n  * Length of stay: Anticipated 4-7 days, then likely discharge to skilled nursing facility (SNF) for continued PT/OT\n\n# GERIATRICS - MULTIPLE GERIATRIC SYNDROMES (FRAILTY, FALLS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DELIRIUM RISK)\n- **GERIATRICS CONSULT** requested for:\n  * **Delirium prevention and management** (patient already showing signs of confusion/delirium)\n  * **Fall risk assessment**\n  * **Osteoporosis management**\n  * **Cognitive assessment**\n  * **Discharge planning** (likely needs higher level of care than home initially)\n\n- **DELIRIUM PREVENTION (high-risk patient):**\n  * Already showing signs: Disoriented to time, repetitive questions, more confused than baseline\n  * **Prevention strategies:**\n    - Minimize sedating medications (use lowest effective opioid dose)\n    - Frequent reorientation (clock, calendar visible, tell patient where she is)\n    - Hearing aids in place at all times\n    - Glasses available\n    - Adequate sleep (minimize nighttime disruptions)\n    - Early mobilization post-op\n    - Avoid Foley catheter if possible post-op (remove ASAP)\n    - Maintain hydration\n    - Family presence (daughter encouraged to visit frequently, provide familiar face)\n\n- **FALL RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n  * Multiple risk factors: Age, cognitive impairment, history of 2 falls, osteoporosis, lives alone\n  * Will need comprehensive assessment by geriatrics\n  * Post-op: High risk (new hip surgery, pain, deconditioning, medications)\n  * Will need PT/OT, assistive device (walker), possibly higher level of care\n\n- **OSTEOPOROSIS MANAGEMENT:**\n  * Patient has severe osteoporosis, NOT on treatment since 2020\n  * This fracture IS a fragility fracture (low-energy fall resulting in fracture - cardinal sign of osteoporosis)\n  * **MUST restart pharmacologic treatment** to prevent future fractures\n  * Options: Bisphosphonate (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid), denosumab, teriparatide\n  * Will discuss with geriatrics and patient/family\n  * Increase calcium to 1200mg daily, increase vitamin D to 2000 units daily\n\n# CARDIOVASCULAR - HYPERTENSION (STABLE)\n- BP 155/85 (elevated from pain/stress)\n- Continue amlodipine 5mg daily (hold day of surgery per anesthesia)\n- Monitor BP post-operatively\n\n# PAIN MANAGEMENT (MULTIMODAL APPROACH)\n- Hip fracture is VERY painful\n- **Multimodal analgesia:**\n  * **Acetaminophen 650mg PO Q6H scheduled** (standing, first-line for elderly)\n  * **Morphine 2-4mg IV Q4H PRN** for breakthrough pain (use lowest effective dose given age and delirium risk)\n  * Post-op: Will transition to oral opioids (oxycodone 5mg Q4-6H PRN)\n  * **Avoid NSAIDs** (increased bleeding risk perioperatively, also renal concerns in elderly)\n  * Consider nerve block by anesthesia for surgery\n\n# ANEMIA - MILD NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA (BASELINE UNCLEAR)\n- Hgb 10.8 on admission\n- Etiology unclear - may be anemia of chronic disease, nutritional (iron deficiency), or chronic blood loss\n- Will drop further post-operatively (blood loss from surgery)\n- Monitor CBC post-op\n- Transfusion threshold: Hgb <7 g/dL or symptomatic (chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension)\n- 2 units PRBCs available if needed\n\n# FLUIDS/NUTRITION\n- NPO until after surgery\n- IV fluids: NS at 75 mL/hr (gentle rate for elderly patient, avoid fluid overload)\n- Post-op: Resume diet as tolerated\n\n# PROPHYLAXIS\n- **DVT:** Heparin 5000 units SQ Q8H (start tonight) - hip fracture is HIGH RISK for DVT/PE\n- **GI:** Not indicated pre-op (will start post-op if on opioids)\n- **Bowel:** Docusate 100mg PO BID (start tonight)\n\n# CODE STATUS: **FULL CODE** (confirmed with patient and daughter)\n- Healthcare proxy: Daughter Karen Wilson\n\n# DISPOSITION\n- Admit to orthopedic surgery service\n- Surgery tomorrow morning (10/04)\n- Anticipated length of stay: 4-7 days\n- **Will likely discharge to SNF** (skilled nursing facility) for continued PT/OT and rehabilitation\n  * Patient lives alone, will not be able to manage independently immediately post-op\n  * Needs intensive PT to regain mobility and strength\n  * Daughter works full-time, cannot provide 24-hour care at home initially\n  * Goal: Return home with home health services after 2-4 weeks at SNF\n\n# PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION\n- Discussion with patient (to extent possible given pain and mild confusion) and daughter Karen:\n  * Diagnosis: Hip fracture from fall, requires surgery to fix\n  * Surgery: Tomorrow morning, will put screws or plate to hold bone together\n  * Recovery: Will need physical therapy, may need temporary stay at rehab facility\n  * Prognosis: Many elderly patients with hip fractures do well with surgery and therapy, but recovery takes time (weeks to months)\n  * Fall prevention: Will need to address fall risk factors to prevent future falls\n  * Osteoporosis: Need to restart treatment for bones to prevent future fractures\n- Daughter very involved, asking many questions\n- Both understand plan, agree with surgery\n- Discussed likely need for SNF placement temporarily - daughter agrees this makes sense, patient hesitant but understands\n\nPlan discussed with Dr. Michael Johnson (attending orthopedic surgeon). Surgery scheduled for tomorrow 08:00. Geriatrics consult placed. Anesthesia will evaluate patient tonight. Patient resting comfortably with pain control.\n\n___________________________\nDr. Michael Johnson, MD\nOrthopedic Surgery\nPager: 5-6789\nTime: 11:30\n"}, {"note_type": "progress", "text": "\nPROGRESS NOTE\nPatient: WILSON, DOROTHY HELEN\nUnit No: 66778899\nDate: 10/08/2024 (Hospital Day 6, Post-Operative Day 4)\nService: ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY\nAttending: Dr. Michael Johnson\n\nSUBJECTIVE:\nPatient reports feeling \"better every day.\" States right hip pain is \"much improved\" - now 3/10 at rest, 5/10 with movement (down from 9/10 on admission).
